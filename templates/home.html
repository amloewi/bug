      <h4> An insistent text message reminder service </h4>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-7">
          Alarms only go off once. When they do go off, you're busy, and an hour after the
          alarm, the thing you needed to do still needs to be done, but you've forgotten about it
          again. Especially if you're sorta avoiding it on purpose ... but you can't let me keep doing that!

          <p><p>
          <b>bug</b> takes the more intuitive, and direct approach. It reminds you of something, repeatedly, until you do it.
          Like a person would. Like you wish you could do for yourself. Because you know that's how things get done.

          <p><p>
          The interface is just as simple. Send a text to the bug number in the format:

          <h3> name, message [, interval=30 [, repeats=5 ]] </h3>

          <br>
          Where <b>name</b> is the name of the reminder (which in the future, you'll be able to  use to
          cancel the reminders once you've done the thing), <b>message</b> is the message you'll get
          when the reminder is sent, <b>interval</b> is the number of minutes in between reminders (which
          defaults to 30, if you don't enter anything), and <b>repeats</b> is the number of times the reminder will
          be sent (which defaults to 5, if you don't enter anything).
          <p><p>

          <h3> Examples </h3>

          <b>Groceries, Buy groceries for tomorrow!, 60, 3</b>
          <br>
          This will send the message 3 times, 60 minutes apart.
          <p><p>

          <b>Book, Return the library book, 20</b>
          <br>
          This will send the message 5 times (because that's the "repeats" default), 20 minutes apart
          <p><p>

          <b>Gym, Go the gym before dinner at 8</b>
          <br>
          This will send the message 5 times (by default) 30 minutes apart (by default).

        </div>
        <div class="col-md-3 col-md-offset-1">
          <b>bug</b> is in the middle of development, so things are going to change, and also not always work.
          In particular, at the moment, it's finicky about input format, so be careful -- and don't put
          commas in your message!
          But if you'd like to give it a try, email me at <b>aloewi</b> â˜ƒ <b>cmu.edu</b>
          and I'll send you the number it uses. Oh, and call your mom.

  <h1>bug</h1>

  <p>An insistent SMS-based reminder service.</p>

  <p>The input string for bug is:</p>

  <p><strong>name of job">>, <message>, [, <minutes between reminders> [, <times message will be sent> ]]</strong></p>

  <p>With defaults on the last two, optional parameters being 30 minutes between reminders, and 5 repeated messages.</p>

  <p><strong>Ex:</strong> <em>Food, Go buy food!, 30, 4</em> # The job named "Food" will send you the message "Go buy food! 4 times, 30 minutes apart.</p>

  <p><strong>Ex:</strong> <em>Call, Call Shelly</em> # The job named "Call" will send you the message "Call Shelly" 5 times, 30 minutes apart, because those are the defaults on the paramaters.</p>

  <p>The name of the job is meant as an identifier by which the job can be cancelled, with 'Did <job>' but that feature has not yet been implemented.</p>
