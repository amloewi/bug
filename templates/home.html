      <h1> bug </h1>

      <h4> An insistent text message reminder service </h4>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-6">

          <b>bug</b> reminds you of something, repeatedly, until you do it.
          Like a person would. Like you wish you could do for yourself. Because you know that's how things get done.
          It's that simple.

          <p><p>
          Using <b>bug</b> is just as simple. Here's what would happen if you sent it some texts.

          <h3> Examples </h3>

          <b>Buy groceries for tomorrow!</b>
          <br>
          If you sent <b>bug</b> this text, it would be sent back to you every 30 minutes, 5 times.
          <p><p>

          <b>Return the library book 20</b>
          <br>
          If you sent this one, the messages would be 20 minutes apart, but there'd still be 5.
          <p><p>

          <b>Go to the gym before dinner 60 2</b>
          <br>
          You'd get this message 60 minutes apart, 2 times.
          <p><p>

          <b>Did beetle/ Cancel ant</b>
          <br>
          When you set a reminder, <b>bug</b> assigns it a name, like 'beetle', and sends you a
          message to tell you what that name is. You can use that name
          to stop the reminder, if you finish the thing you wanted to do (congratulations!) or
          cancel it, if you made a mistake.
          <p><p>

          <br>
          If you have a number at the end of your message like "Dinner at 8", just make sure it has a period
          (or something) after it to make it clear it's not meant to be a parameter.<p>
          <b>bug</b> will do the rest.


        </div>
        <div class="col-md-3 col-md-offset-1">
          <b>bug</b> is in the middle of development, so things are going to change, and also not always work.
          But if you'd like to give it a try, email me at <b>aloewi</b> â˜ƒ <b>cmu.edu</b>
          and I'll send you the number it uses. Oh, and call your mom.
          <p>

  <h1>bug</h1>

  <p>An insistent SMS-based reminder service.</p>

  <p>The input string for bug is:</p>

  <p><strong>name of job">>, <message>, [, <minutes between reminders> [, <times message will be sent> ]]</strong></p>

  <p>With defaults on the last two, optional parameters being 30 minutes between reminders, and 5 repeated messages.</p>

  <p><strong>Ex:</strong> <em>Food, Go buy food!, 30, 4</em> # The job named "Food" will send you the message "Go buy food! 4 times, 30 minutes apart.</p>

  <p><strong>Ex:</strong> <em>Call, Call Shelly</em> # The job named "Call" will send you the message "Call Shelly" 5 times, 30 minutes apart, because those are the defaults on the paramaters.</p>

  <p>The name of the job is meant as an identifier by which the job can be cancelled, with 'Did <job>' but that feature has not yet been implemented.</p>
